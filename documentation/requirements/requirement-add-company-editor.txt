Database & Schema

1. Are companyId fields required or nullable on User and Project?
2. Should existing users/projects be assigned to the seeded "4All Digital" company, or left null?

Company Settings Page:
3. You mentioned "type to filter" - what types exist for companies, or did you mean "type to search/filter by name"?
4. Delete behavior: hard delete or soft delete? What happens to users/projects linked to a deleted company?

User & Project Pages:
5. Is company selection required when creating/editing users and projects, or optional?
6. For projects: if the current user has no company assigned, what should the default be?

Validation:
7. Should company URL be validated (format check)?
8. Should company name be unique?

Seed Data:
9. I noticed http://4all.digtal - should this be https://4all.digital?

Navigation:
10. Confirm placement: Settings nav order will be Preflight Categories → Company → Users?

1 - required
2 - "4All Digital"
3 - "type to search/filter by name"
4 - recommend. I am leaning soft. also, we don't want to delete the associated project data - maybe it can be reassigned some kind of permanent company
5 - required
6 - similar questions raised with #4. provide some options
7 - yes - we have url validation here - app/(dashboard)/releasepass/preflight/new/page.tsx - can we use a shared validation for this? (hate to not be dry)
8 - no
9 - yes
