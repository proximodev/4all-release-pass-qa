Issue:
Language Tool is throwing a large number of "Add a space between sentences." errors, which I am guessing happens after cheerio grabs the page and we parse the content from html and send to Language Tool.

Here is one instance:
"Consultation How We Work Human Insight.Automated Speed. We merge experienced developers" and with the HTML below we have a separation between "Human Insight" and "Automated Speed":

<h2 class="workflow__title" data-reveal="heading" data-reveal-delay="100"><span class="text-yellow">Human Insight.</span><br>Automated Speed.</h2>

I suspect this is the dominant pattern, and we may need to sub "<br>" for " ".

Review worker code and provide an analysis:
worker/providers/spelling

This fixed most issues, but oddly, i'm seeing this:

Space error:
"...lds Ready to Build Something that Lasts?Let's build your growth, not just your webs..."

HTML:
<h2 data-reveal="heading" class="small content-container">Ready to <strong>Build Something that Lasts</strong>?</h2>
<p data-reveal="heading" class="subhead content-container">Let's build your growth, not just your website.</p>
