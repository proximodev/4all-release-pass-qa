Request:
--------
On the spelling results page, I would like to add a link in the Context column that opens the current page with "Text Fragmen(aka #:~:text=) parameter that passes the highlight text.

The link should be inline and simply look like "(View)" and open in a new tab.

Review code and ask questions.

---

Questions:
1. URL source: The ResultsProps doesn't currently include the page URL. I'll need to add a url prop and pass it from TestResultDetail (which has urlResult.url). Is that acceptable?
2. Text fragment content: The Text Fragments API supports different formats:
- Simple: #:~:text=misspelled (just the word)
- With context: #:~:text=before-,misspelled,-after (prefix and suffix for disambiguation)

Since we have the full context string with offset/length, I can extract prefix and suffix text to help browsers find the exact match. Should I use the simple format (just the highlighted word) or include surrounding context for more accurate matching?
3. Link placement: Should "(View)" appear:
- After the highlighted context text (inline within the cell)
- Or separate, perhaps right-aligned in the same cell?

Answers:
1 - Results has a "view page" button which is the current page. All ResultItems for a details page will have the same URL.
2 - Let's do with context
3 - Inline AFTER the context text. I think this will be best.

Questions:
Empty context handling: Some items might not have context data (contextText is empty or contextLength is 0). In those cases, should I:
- Hide the "(View)" link entirely
- Show "(View)" but link to the page without a text fragment (just the URL)
2. Link styling: Should "(View)" use the text-brand-cyan style like other links in the app, or stay as default text color?
3. Prefix/suffix length: The Text Fragments API works better with shorter prefix/suffix (a few words). The context string might be long. Should I:
- Use the full prefix/suffix from the context
- Trim to last/first ~20-30 characters (or a few words) for cleaner URLs

Answers:
1 - yes, hide view link
2 - default. no inline styles
3 - trim

Files to modify:

1. components/releasepass/results/types.ts
- Add optional url?: string prop to ResultsProps
2. components/releasepass/TestResultDetail.tsx
- Pass url={urlResult?.url} to SpellingResults component
3. components/releasepass/results/SpellingResults.tsx
- Accept url prop
- Create helper function buildTextFragmentUrl(url, prefix, target, suffix) that:
    - Trims prefix to last ~30 chars (or last few words)
  - Trims suffix to first ~30 chars (or first few words)
  - URL-encodes the text fragment components
  - Returns full URL with #:~:text=prefix-,target,-suffix
- Add "(View)" link after contextDisplay when context data exists and URL is available
- Link opens in new tab with target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

Ready to implement?
