Baseline:
--------

1 - Empty links (#)
- Update to exclude links in head

Questions 1:
1. Reporting behavior for excluded nav dropdowns:
- Option A: Completely silent (no ResultItem created)
- Option B: Report as INFO severity (logged but no penalty)
- Option C: Report as PASS with note that dropdown triggers were detected and excluded
2. Severity for remaining empty links (outside nav context): Keep as BLOCKER, or downgrade?
3. Should I add richer context to flagged empty links? Currently only captures immediate parent tag. Could add:
- Whether it's inside any nav element (even if not a dropdown trigger)
- Full ancestor path (e.g., "footer > div > a")

Answers 1:
1 - Leaning Option B. But give this a different code such as PREFLIGHT_EMPTY_NAV_LINK. Discuss and challenge.
2 - Let's keep as blocker. However, we do have a ReleaseRun table and should use that as a source of truth. Hardcoded value can be a fallback. Review code and let us discuss.
3 - Yes, let's include more context. For navlink case, this should have it's own code and issue description and detail. For PREFLIGHT_EMPTY_NAV_LINK what would you recommend? For other links, let's review this separately.

1 - I think INFO is good. But would INFO be listed with FAILED or PASSED groupings? Review
2 - Please clarify: Worker does use the lookup table - correct? Or do only some tests use lookup? I believe this is a different and larger task - and quite critical. We may want to leverage both - errors might lean dynamic for name (since they will offer additional detail / context) and other fields from db. Where pass may be all DB. Let's mark for review AFTER empty links is done.
3 - Name and description are good.
