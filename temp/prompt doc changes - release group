You are updating documentation for the ReleasePass product.

Context:
- ReleasePass uses a Release Run model.
- A Release Run represents a single launch candidate.
- URLs are frozen per Release Run.
- Page-level tests run inside a Release Run.
- Site-level audits are NOT part of Release Runs.
- Release readiness is computed per Release Run, not across unrelated test timestamps.
- A Release Run can be PENDING, READY, or FAIL.
- Page Preflight includes Lighthouse SEO (binary checks), Linkinator, and Custom Rules.

Task:
1. Read the provided documentation section carefully.
2. Identify any content that:
   - assumes readiness is computed from “latest tests”
   - lacks the Release Run concept
   - mixes page-level and site-level tests
   - implies mutable URL sets
3. Update the section to:
   - explicitly reference Release Runs where applicable
   - align scoring and readiness logic to Release Runs
   - reflect frozen URL sets and rerunnable tests
   - preserve existing tone and structure unless incorrect
4. Do NOT invent new features or expand scope.
5. If a section is already correct, say so explicitly and explain why.

Output:
- Provide the revised documentation section in Markdown.
- Include a brief summary of what changed and why.

Here is the documentation section to update:
